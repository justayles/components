#### Steps to create

Add new component, default styles and test, add storybook etc

git commit will eslint && FIX if it can, as well as prettify (if saving hasnrt done that already)
git push will run tests first

#### to update package

1. change version number in package.json
2. run 'npm run build' to bundle with rollup
3. 'npm publish'

can import then from @justayles/components@latest
